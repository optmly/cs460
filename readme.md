For 460, 3% bonuses for attending recitations. Note that materials from recitations will appear on exams (up to 10%).

For 560, students may choose to do a research project instead of doing exams. Interested students should inform me by 09/15. Must decide (choose one) before 10/01. Note that projects are expect to take much more time (and more difficult) than preparing for exams. By default, exams are assumed. 

Letter grades curved based on performance; ~25% A, ~75% B or better   

There are potential opportunities for a small amount of bonuses that cannot be anticipated/planned, e.g., taking attendance on a random date.
