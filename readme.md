### Grading: 	

The class will be graded based on **homeowrk (3 sets, 25%)**, **coding assignments (3 sets, 25%)**,  a **course project (20%)**, and a **final exam(30%)**. Homework and coding assignments will be graded mainly based on submission (80%) and spot checking (20%, i.e., grading some randomly selected problems or checking code performance for certain subroutines). 

Letter grades curved based on performance; ~30% A, ~75% B or better.
